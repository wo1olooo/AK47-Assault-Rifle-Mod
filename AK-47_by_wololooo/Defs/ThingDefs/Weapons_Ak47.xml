    <label>AK-47</label>
    <description>A rugged, timeworn assault rifle from the lost world of Earth — humanity’s first cradle, now wrapped in legend and silence. The AK-47 delivers reliable automatic fire using the 7.62×39mm cartridge, sacrificing finesse for brute durability. Born as the evolution of the flawed AS44 — a prototype rifle that never quite met expectations — the AK-47 emerged from decades of trial and error during Old Earth’s turbulent final days.

Though countless centuries have passed since its creation, its design endures. Recovered from corrupted schematics aboard a derelict void freighter drifting through the endless dark, this rifle was painstakingly rebuilt on the Rim by a determined few who sought to reclaim the lost art of survival. It jams less, hits hard, and shrugs off grime and neglect — just as it did in the ancient wars of a forgotten planet, where resources were scarce and reliability meant life or death.

The AS44, once a hopeful but ultimately unsuccessful step, laid the groundwork for this legend — a weapon refined not for elegance, but for sheer dependability in unforgiving conditions.

It is a tool shaped by countless hands, passed down through generations, a testament to human resilience and ingenuity. Its rugged form carries the echoes of battles long vanished beneath layers of dust and time.

It’s not refined. It’s not rare. It just works.

A survivor’s weapon from a mythic age, reborn in dust and fire — a relic that still carries the weight of humanity’s first home, standing as a silent guardian in the shadow of forgotten legends.
