    <description>Born from the ashes of Old Earth’s deadliest war, the AK-47 was designed for simplicity, power, and survival. Chambered in 7.62×39mm and built for function over finesse, it became the rifle of soldiers, rebels, and survivors alike. Centuries later, its schematic surfaced in a derelict Rimworld comms station — battered, but intact. Now, this symbol of reliability is ready to be forged again, not for empires — but for those who endure.
