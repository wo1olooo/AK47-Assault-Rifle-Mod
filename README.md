You must have:
- [Soviet Rifle Research Tab by Wololooo](https://github.com/wo1olooo/Soviet-Rifle-Research-Tab-by-Wololooo)

## ðŸ“– Lore Summary

Forged in the aftermath of Old Earthâ€™s last global war, the AK-47 is the perfected evolution of earlier prototypes like the AVS-36 and AS-44. Rugged, simple, and reliable, it became a symbol of survivability â€” and now, thanks to reconstructed blueprints found deep in the Rim, it lives again.


## âœ… Compatibility

- Tested with RimWorld 1.5 and 1.6
